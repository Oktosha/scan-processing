# Illustrational data for 3D-scans processing pipeline

This repo contains data obtained by following model 3D-scans processing pipeline:

1. Alignment
2. Normals Estimation
3. Surface Reconstruction
4. Remeshing

The steps are performed using [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net/).

The model data is famous [Stanford Bunny](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/).
